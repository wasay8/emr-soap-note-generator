# EMR SOAP Note Generator

This project is a clinical documentation assistant that generates structured **SOAP-format medical reports** (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) from Electronic Medical Record (EMR) data using **GPT-4 via LangChain**. It follows formal documentation standards used in North American hospitals.

---

## Features

- Parses structured EMR data including Patient, Admission, Diagnosis, and Lab records
- Generates clinically accurate SOAP notes based on lab results and diagnoses
- Groups lab values under standard medical panels (CBC, Metabolic Panel, Urinalysis)
- Utilizes GPT-4 through LangChain for context-aware report generation
- Provides an interactive user interface using Streamlit

---

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas
- Streamlit
- LangChain
- OpenAI GPT-4
- dotenv for environment variable management

---

## Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/emr-soap-note-generator.git
cd emr-soap-note-generator
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

---

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY_2=your_openai_api_key
```

---

## Usage

Run the Streamlit application:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Steps:

1. Select a Patient ID and Admission ID from dropdown menus.
2. Review structured data including patient information, diagnoses, and labs.
3. Click the "Create Report" button to generate a SOAP note.
4. Review or copy the generated clinical report.

## Future Improvements

* Automatic detection and highlighting of abnormal lab values
* Inclusion of reference ranges alongside lab results
* PDF and DOCX export of generated SOAP reports
* Integration with FHIR-compatible EHR systems

Let me know if you'd also like me to generate:
- `requirements.txt`
- `.env.example`
- a minimal dataset structure for the `data/` folder

I can provide those next.
