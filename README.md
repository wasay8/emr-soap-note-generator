# 🩺 EMR SOAP Note Generator

A clinical documentation assistant that generates structured **SOAP-format medical reports** (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) from Electronic Medical Record (EMR) data using **GPT-4 via LangChain**. Designed to follow documentation standards used in **North American hospitals**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Supports structured patient, admission, diagnosis, and lab data
- ✅ Generates formal SOAP notes with accurate medical interpretation
- ✅ Groups lab values into standard panels (CBC, Metabolic, Urinalysis)
- ✅ Uses GPT-4 with LangChain to produce high-quality clinical text
- ✅ Streamlit UI for interactive exploration and report generation

---

## 📊 Tech Stack

- **Python** (Pandas, Streamlit)
- **LangChain** + **OpenAI GPT-4**
- Environment management via `.env`
- Data visualizations using Streamlit’s `st.dataframe`


---

## ⚙️ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/emr-soap-note-generator.git
